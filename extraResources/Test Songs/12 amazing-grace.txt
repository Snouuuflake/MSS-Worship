!-T Amazing Grace
!-A Chris Tomlin

!-S V1
Amazing grace how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me

I once was lost, but now I'm found
Was blind, but now I see

!-S V2
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved

How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

!-S C1
My chains are gone, I've been set free
My God, my Savior has ransomed me

And like a flood His mercy reigns
Unending love
Amazing grace

!-S V3
The Lord has promised good to me
His word my hope secures

He will my shield and portion be
As long as life endures

!-S V4
The earth shall soon dissolve like snow
The sun forbear to shine

But God, who called me here below
Will be forever mine, will be forever mine
You are forever mine
