- [X] current selected verse doesnt reset when changing song
- [X] no indicator for the last-selected verse
- [X] using a mouse doesnt update what verse was last selected with arrow keys
- [ ] installer creates extraResources folder twice :/- only one actually does something
	this ones done in theory but ima test it first
- [X] logo clips into top of main window
- [ ] make display divs have absolute positioning and remove background container div margins- padding makes this redundant

- [ ] set up fade transitions maybe (it might be better to do this in v0.2.0)
