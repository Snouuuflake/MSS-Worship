- [ ] current selected verse doesnt reset when changing song
- [ ] no indicator for the last-selected verse
- [ ] using a mouse doesnt update what verse was last selected with arrow keys
- [ ] installer creates extraResources folder twice :/- only one actually does something
- [ ] logo clips into top of main window
- [ ] make display divs have absolute positioning and remove background container div margins- padding makes this redundant

- [ ] set up fade transitions maybe (it might be better to do this in v0.2.0)
