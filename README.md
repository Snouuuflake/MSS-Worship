# MSS-Worship
An open-source Electron app for displaying song lyrics, images, and more, designed with worship in mind.

## Backstory
This project was born out of the need for projecting the lyrics to worship songs, along with images, verses, and other media, both with very large font, to be projected on a stage, and as captions for livestreamed services. Originally, the solution was to run a presentation software on two computers simultaneously, one for each use case, but due to a shortage of voulenteer staff, this proved difficult. 

Thus, the project was started with the following objectives in mind.

## Initial Project Goals
- Loading song lyrics and data (title and author) from a simple, plain-text format
- Saving and sharing set lists in a way that individuallly manages and resolves missing files
- Projecting lyrics and images to between one and two windows simultaneously, each with individual styling
- Allowing the user to set the HTML class of each element of a set list in the GUI, allowing for
  the user to customize the styling of each class, and add custom styling
- Implementation api.bible

## Longer-term Goals
- Support for more than two projection windows
- Integrated Bible translations, without the need for an internet connection
